# 2019 NYSE Stocks Database Project

This was a short project with the purpose for the client being to translate TSV (tab seperated values) NYSE daily prices and stock names to a Microsoft SQL Server Database. 

To provide a solution, I used SQL implement the necessary schemas and load the relevant data and created a Python CLI to convert TSV files to CSV to suit the data formatting needs of T-SQL.

I designed the schemas for the database and documented the project including the databse design structure, database management system, data normalisation, entity relationship diagrams and SQL and Python scripts used. 

The project was documented and completed and successfully created the necessary scripts to complete the project. I have the necessary permission to share the details this project and have provided design documents in PDF form.
